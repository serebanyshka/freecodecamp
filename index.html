            <p class="quote">"I feel a sacred question about fear: Was you afraid? Of course, I was afraid but maybe I was a coward
                sometimes. But there are a lot of fears in the war and they're all different. Fear of the Germans
                - that they could capture, shoot; fear of the fire, especially artillery or bombing. If the explosion
                is near, so that seems, body is ready to burst into pieces from wild agony itself, without participation
                of reason. But there was fear, that came from behind — from the authorities, all those punitive organs
                that were no less in the war than in the peaceful time. Even more."</p>
